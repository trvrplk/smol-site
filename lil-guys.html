		<p>I found Yamcha and Puar these from someone's personal Geocities site; they originally came from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/duoofwildfire/chibi">here</a>, although these ones were missing. There's some more (some other DB characters and some Sailor Moon and Gundam Wing ones as well) <a href="https://tilde.club/~trever/lil-guys/chibidreams-misc">here</a>.</p>
